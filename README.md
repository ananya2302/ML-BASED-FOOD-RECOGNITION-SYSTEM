#FOOD-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM based on DEEP LEARNING AND CNN

Food recognition and calorie display system using deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Tensorflow and MobileNet is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we monitor our food intake and make informed decisions about our diet and nutrition. 

This technology involves the use of machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to automatically recognize different types of food items from images and display their calorie content.

In this project, we provide an overview of the process involved in 
developing a food recognition and calorie display system using 
Tensorflow and MobileNet.

The steps involved are data collection, preprocessing, model 
training, testing and validation and displaying the calories of the 
predicted food item. We describe the dataset collection and 
preprocessing steps, which involve collecting a large dataset of 
food images and labels, and preprocessing the images to normalize 
their size and pixel values. We discuss the model training and 
evaluation stages, which involve training the MobileNet model on the preprocessed dataset and verifying its prediction accuracy.We also highlight the potential applications of this technology that can be extended to various domains, such as mobile and web-based nutrition tracking tools. 

Overall, we conclude that food recognition and calorie display using Tensorflow and MobileNet has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of calorie measurement, which is essential for promoting healthy eating habits and preventing diet related diseases.
